          Hi, I'm Eric Barrero Giménez and I'm an Android Developer. I've
          been studying Software Developement for 2 years at
          <i>Centre d'Estudis Monlau</i>, and now I'm stdying Kotlin at my
          own, as due to COVID we could't be able to sudy it on
          <i>DAM</i>.<br /><br />
          On the first two years I've studied DAM (Cross-platform Application Development):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            On the first year I have learnt pure Java including basic things
            like variable types, loops, Data-Structures, Graphics Windows
            (Swing), etc.<br />
            More at <a href="#1DAM"><b><i>1 DAM</i></b></a>.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            On the second year, talking about Java, I have learnt more Graphics 
            Windows (Swing), Sockets, Reverse Engineering, DAOs.<br />
            If we talk about Android, this was my first year. I've started learning 
            the basics as Creating activities, knowing the basic views and implementing 
            all the Java things I have learnt the previous year, and later on, I also 
            learnt the Activity and Fragment lifecycle, Threads, SQLite, etc. Then I 
            started making little apps "playing" with the sensors (proximity, geolocation, 
            compass, etc.); a music, photo and video player; or an app with management and 
            manipulation of an internal local database.<br />
            More at <a href="#2DAM"><b><i>2 DAM</i></b></a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          On the next year I've studied ASIX (Systems and Network Administration):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This year I have learnt in great measure Database, Network and Operating
            System management. Also the most used software and utilities to configure
            the newtork or troubleshoot the systems.<br />

          <p>
            After four good years at ESO with an average grade of 7 / 8, my
            teachears encouraged me to go to <i>Bachillerato</i> (Secondary
            School Certificate) instead of doing
            <i>CFGM (Ciclo Formativo de Grado Medio)</i> (Vocational
            Training).<br /><br />
            During these two years I studied the Technological branch, and 
            my optional subjects were Technology, Physics and Chemistry.<br /><br />
            My final grade was ~6.5, but I was convinced that my strong was practical 
            and not theoretical.

            After <i>Bachillerato</i> I started <i>1º DAM</i>, as coding is
            something that has always intrigued me. It was 2 years long and
            the 1<sup>st</sup> year was a mix between software development
            <i>(DAM)</i> and system and network administration
            <i>(ASIX)</i>.<br /><br />
            During this year I studied:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Windows Desktop, Windows Server, Linux Desktop and Linux Server
              Management.

            This 2<sup>nd</sup> and last year of <i>DAM</i> was 100% software
            development. During this year I studied:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Android (Java).</li>
            <li>Java (Data-Structures, Sockets, Reverse Engineering).</li>
            <li>C#.</li>
            <li>PHP.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As this was the last year of <i>DAM</i>, we needed to make a final
            project. We were ready to work with hospitals and make a project
            about alzheihmer and/or parkinson, but COVID-19 preventud us that
            project. So we made a project with the software infrastructure to
            manage a small/medium restaurant. It contained:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A database stored at Amazon AWS (Amazon RDS).</li>
            <li>
              A Web site made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP to book a
              table and comunicate the DB and the apps via JSON.
            </li>
            <li>
              A desktop application made with C# to manage the users and
              admins, the available meals and menus, and a section dedicated
              to let the chefs know the food needed to cook.
            </li>
            <li>
              An Android application made with Java used by the
              waiters to create the orders of the people who eat at the
              restaurant.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The entire Android app was made by me, and you can check the code
            here:
            <a href="https://github.com/ericbargim/GestMans" target="_blank"><b>GestMans</b></a>. Our final project
            score was 10.<br /><br />This was my best
            year as a student (and probably the one I enjoyed the most) with a
            final grade of <b>~9.7</b>.<br /><br />My final grade of
            <i>DAM</i> is <b>9.32</b>.

          <p>
            As the first year of <i>DAM</i> was mixed with the first year of
            <i>ASIX</i> (Systems and Network Administration), I already got
            <i>1<sup>st</sup> ASIX</i> passed, and I could do
            <i>2ASIX</i> just after <i>2DAM</i>. During this year I studied:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>DB Management.</li>
            <li>Software Utilities.</li>
            <li>Network planning and administration.</li>
            <li>Windows and Linux Server Management.</li>
            <li>Implementation of web applications (Basic PHP).</li>
            <li>Security and High Availability.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Also this year we had to make a final project, so we decided to
            extend last year's project creating all the necessary
            infrastructure to deploy our app at a restaurant. This project
            had:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The design of our headquarters and two restaurants.</li>
            <li>A simulated network infrastructure recreating a real one.</li>
            <li>Again, the DB was stored at Amazon AWS (Amazon RDS).</li>
            <li>
              A Linux server as the Apache server to store the web site.
            </li>
            <li>A Windows Server as RRAS (Simulating a Router).</li>
            <li>
              Other Windows Server managing the Active Directory and DNS.
            </li>
            <li>
              Another Windows Server with Active Directory and DNS to ensure
              High Availability.
            </li>
            <li>
              A NAS to store the updates of the Android and Desktop apps.
            </li>
            <li>A VPN to be able to connect to the NAS.</li>
            <li>A Backup system with the hard drives in RAID.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Also, all the apps from the previous year were updated to ensure
            full compatibility. The entire team worked together at every task,
            so no roles were assigned. Our final project score was also 10.<br /><br />I
            also enjoyed a lot this year, but not as much as <i>DAM</i>. I
            missed a lot these coding moments of thinking how to do a task,
            struggling on how to fix a bug, etc.<br /><br />My final grade of
            <i>ASIX</i> is <b>9.1</b>.
